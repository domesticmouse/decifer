A cross-platform mobile app that helps you to generate transcripts either from a voice recording or by uploading an audio file. The project uses a totally serverless architecture.

## Architecture

The mobile app is created using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) which is integrated with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Firebase **Cloud Functions** is used to deploy the backend code required for communicating with the Deepgram API.

## App overview

The Flutter application consists of the following pages/screens:

* Login Page
* Register Page
* Dashboard Page
* Record Page
* Upload Page
* Transcription Page

For authenticating the user inside the app -- **Login** and **Register** pages are used. Authentication is required to generate unique accounts for users required for storing the generated transcripts to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and facilitate **cloud-sync**.

The **Dashboard Page** displays a list of all the transcripts currently present on the user's account. It also has two buttons - one for navigating to the Record Page and the other for navigating to the Upload Page.

**Record Page** lets you record your audio using the device microphone and the transcribe it using Deepgram. You always have an option to re-record if you think the last recording wasn't good.

From the **Upload Page**, you can choose any audio file present on your device and generate the transcript of it.

**Transcription Page** is where the entire transcript can be viewed. It has an audio-transcript synchronized playback that highlights the text transcript part with respect to the audio that is playing.

You can also see the **confidence map** of each of the parts of the transcript (it shows how much accurate is that part of transcript generation - _darker is higher confidence_).

You can also easily print or share the generated transcript in the **PDF** format.
